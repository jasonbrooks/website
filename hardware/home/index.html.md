# What are you running at home?

{:.no_toc}

Want to run a small OpenStack cloud for personal use, with
whatever old hardware you have laying around? Here's what some of our
community are running at home.

See also the [RDO minicluster](/hardware/minicluster) for an example of
what you can do.

Are you running RDO at home? Write it up and [tell us about
it](mailto:rdo-list@redhat.com) and we'll add you to the list.
