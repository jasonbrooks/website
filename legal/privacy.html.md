# Privacy Statement for the RDO Community

## Scope of This Notice
This Privacy Statement is intended to describe the RDO Community's privacy
practices and provide information about the choices you have regarding the
ways in which information collected by the RDO Community Project is used and
disclosed. For convenience, the RDO Community Project is referred to in this
document as "RDO Community".

## Our Commitment to Privacy
At RDO Community, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your
privacy, we have provided this Statement explaining our information practices
and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is
collected, used and disclosed. To make this Statement easy to find, we have
made it available on our homepage and at every location where
personally-identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect

used to identify an individual.

RDO Community collects personal data when:

* you create a user account;

RDO Community may also collect personal data from individuals (with their
consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions.

The types of personal data collected may include (but are not limited to):

* your SSH public key,
* your IRC nickname,
* your language preference,
* your timezone,
* your geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude),
* your affiliation(s).

## Publicly Available Personal Data
In keeping with the open nature and spirit of RDO Community, some personal
data attached to RDO Community accounts is made public by default.

Specifically:

If you wish for this information to be kept private, please email
privacy@rdoproject.org. If you choose to opt-out, RDO Community will still have access to this information, but it will not be displayed to others, and will be
considered Private. The only exception to this is for your email address,
which may still be visible in some RDO Community services such as Bugzilla.

## Using (Processing) Your Personal Data
RDO Community uses the personal data you provide to:

* create and maintain your accounts;
* identify and authenticate you;
* attribute data and content you produce directly and indirectly in our
public-facing services;
* answer your questions;
* send you information;
* for research activities, including the production of statistical reports (such aggregated information is not used to contact the subjects of the report);
* send you surveys.

We also use this personal data to provide you with information related to your account and the products or services you acquire from us, to better understand your needs and interests, to improve our service, to personalize communications, and to comply with or fulfill any contractual obligations to you. It is in RDO Community’s legitimate business interests to provide you with the information, communications, and services you request; to create a public record of the data and content produced by RDO Community’s services; and to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research purposes.

## Sharing Your Personal Data
Unless you consent, RDO Community will never process or share the personal
data you provide to us except as described below.

RDO Community may disclose your personal data to third parties under any of
the following circumstances:

* Your publicly available personal data in the RDO Community account system,
as described above, is accessible by anyone unless you, as the account holder,
opt out as already described in this Privacy Statement.
* As required to provide service, and for e-mail housing (as a consequence
of uses already described in this Privacy Statement). It is in RDO Community’s
legitimate business interest to provide all users an accurate record of data
and content provided by RDO Community’s services, and to maintain the
integrity of that data and content for historical, scientific, and research
purposes. This data and content may include but is not limited to email, code
changes, comments, and artifacts. 
* As required by law (such as responding to a valid subpoena, warrant,
audit, or agency action, or to prevent fraud).
* For research activities, including the production of statistical reports
(such aggregated information is used to describe our services and is not used
to contact the subjects of the report).

## Receiving E-Mail
RDO Community may send you e-mail about your account, to inform you of
important upcoming RDO Community events (e.g. elections), or in response to
your questions. For your protection, RDO Community may contact you in the
event that we find an issue that requires your immediate attention. RDO
Community processes your personal data in these cases to fulfill and comply
with its contractual obligations to you, to provide the services you have
requested, and to ensure the security of your account.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information
RDO Community's online services automatically capture IP addresses. We use IP
addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our
website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with our
services. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your location, in
order to provide you data and content from our services as quickly as
possible. It is in RDO Community’s legitimate business interest to maximize
the efficiency and effectiveness of its services for all users.

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, RDO
Community uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A
cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web
server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sections of [Community
Website] where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require
your browser to accept cookies.

Generally, we use cookies to:

* Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on
our computers) in order to provide a better and more personalized service.
This cookie is set when you register or "sign in" and is modified when you
"sign out" of our services.
* Estimate audience size. Each browser accessing RDO Community is given a
unique cookie that is used to determine the extent of repeat usage and usage
by a registered user versus by an unregistered user.
* Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions,
sweepstakes, and contests. When a RDO Community hosted promotion uses cookies,
the information written to the cookie indicates the person's progress through
the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in
prize drawings.
* Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of RDO Community's network
of websites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We
use this research to understand how our user's habits are similar or different
from one another so that we can make each new experience on [Community
Website] a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the
content, banners, and promotions you and other users will see on our sites.

If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can
configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you
each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use
of cookies may be necessary to provide certain services, and choosing to
reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your
browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable, disable
or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located in the “Help”, “Tools”
or “Edit” facility).

## Our Commitment to Data Security
RDO Community trains its administrators on our privacy policy guidelines and
makes our privacy policy available to our partners. Our website uses Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal data when you send
your personal information on our website. In addition, RDO Community and its
partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and
precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal
data.

## Public Forums Reminder
RDO Community often makes chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, message boards,
and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.
Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data. Although we
value individual ideas and encourage free expression, RDO Community reserves
the right to take necessary action to preserve the integrity of these areas,
such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate. It is in RDO
Community’s legitimate business interests to provide all users an accurate
record of data and content provided in the public forums it maintains and
uses; to maintain the integrity of that data and content for historical,
scientific, and research purposes; and to provide an environment for the free
exchange of ideas relevant and constructive to the development and propagation
of open source software.

## Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy
Out of special concern for children's privacy, RDO Community does not
knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of
13. RDO Community does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to
become registered members of our sites. RDO Community does not knowingly
collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.

In the event that RDO Community ever decides to expand its intended site
audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages
will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy
notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, RDO Community will provide
an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to
subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal
information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.

## About Links to Other Sites
This site contains links to other sites. RDO Community does not control the
information collection of sites that can be reached through links from
[Community Website]. If you have questions about the data collection
procedures of linked sites, please contact these sites directly.

## Your Rights and Choices in the EEA
Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to
the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by emailing
privacy@rdoproject.org. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated
above are not absolute in all cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you
have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that
you have previously provided to RDO Community, you may do so by emailing
privacy@rdoproject.org. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the
lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

## How to Contact Us
